# Blade And Stone 2

A top-down roguelike game built in C++. This project demonstrates the integration of modern C++ techniques with libraries like Raylib, Box2D, and LDtk. The main goal is to showcase the versatility of C++ in game development by creating an efficient, and extensible game engine capable of handling physics, rendering, and automated systems.

## Features
- Top-down roguelike gameplay with automatic combat
- Level design powered by LDtk with automatic collision handling
- Physics-based movement and collisions using Box2D
- Dynamic enemy spawning system
- Dual Weapon System: Combine sword combat with a bullet-based magic system
- Debug visualization options for developers

## Built With
- **C++20**: Modern features like constexpr, ranges, and smart pointers
- **[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)** (v5.0): 2D graphics library
- **[Box2D](https://box2d.org/)** (v2.4.1): Physics engine
- **[LDtkLoader](https://github.com/Madour/LDtkLoader)** (v1.5.3.1): LDtk level editor integration
- **[{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)** (v10.2.1): String formatting library

## Building

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.22 or higher
- C++20 compatible compiler
- Git

### Debug Build
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
cmake --build . --config Debug
```

### Release Build
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Web Build
```bash
cmake -DPLATFORM=Web ..
cmake --build .
```

### Build Options
- Debug build: `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`
- Release build: `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
- Web build (requires Emscripten): `-DPLATFORM=Web`

## Controls
- WASD - Movement
- Space - Start/Reset game

## Editing LDtk Maps
The game uses LDtk for level design. Here's how to edit maps:

### Entities
1. **Player**: Place the `Player` entity where you want them to start
2. **Enemy Spawner**: Add spawners and customize their properties in LDtk

### Tile Layers
- Place tiles in their correct layers
- Tiles in the `Ground` layer marked as `Solid` automatically handle collision

## Why Raylib and C++?
Raylib provides fast 2D graphics with a clean API, while C++ offers the performance and control needed for development.

## Assets

- Weapon sprites: [Link](https://scracho.itch.io/bright-colored-fantasy-swords-32bit)
- Thanks to the asset creators for providing the resources used in this game.

### Template
This project was built using the [raylib-cpp-cmake-template](https://github.com/tupini07/raylib-cpp-cmake-template) as a starting point. Special thanks to tupini07 for providing this excellent template that helped jumpstart the development process.

### Wait BladeAndStone2 ?? Where is the first one?
- [BladeAndStone](https://github.com/Tlamir/BladeAndStone) - The first version of the game had a much simpler design and far fewer features compared to this.
